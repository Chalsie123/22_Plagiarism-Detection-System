What is our Project about?

We have created a Cricket Score Prediction web application through which a user can predict the score of the remaining innings. We have also used client-server architecture for the implementation of this project. Our project uses the Lasso Regression algorithm by which we got the highest accuracy for a score prediction, We have added client authentication to our application. The frontend is done by React, HTML, CSS & JS with the backend using Python(Flask) and firebase.
