Weather Prediction is the application of science and technology to predict the
amount of rain/storms/cold weather over a region. It is important to exactly determine
the rain/storms/cold weather for effective use of water resources, crop productivity
and pre-planning of water structures.


For this project we have used jupyter notebook, pycharm, db sqlite.
It shows the current weather of the entered city.
